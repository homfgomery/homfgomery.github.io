        Lyrics
    </h3>
    <p>
    <pre>
        Carved out of stone
        Earth, blood and bone
        They knock the mountains down
        The earth's grating sounds
        
        They soothe the great machines
        That yearn desperately
        Just to lay them down
        Within her gaping mouth
        
        More than a symbol
        More than I bargained for
        More than a symbol
        More than I bargained for
        
        They wander ridges high
        Between the earth and sky
        Like spikes upon a crown
        We wear upon our brow
        
        And want is not a need
        Reserved for human beings
        Its fingers on your throat
        Is pain that all things know
        
        More than a symbol
        More than I bargained for
        More than a symbol
        More than I bargained for
        
        An army of the golems is stalking, now, the heart's lands
        Eating all reality
        Producing only dust and sand
        Nothing hurts them
        Nothing gets under their stone skin
        And when their earthen mouths will open up
        And just what words should come out but
        <strong>"We wish we were dead"</strong>
            </pre>

    Fly me to the moon

    Hold my hand

    Darling kiss me

    Fill my heart with song
    And let me sing for ever more
    You are all I long for
    All I worship and adore

    Please be true
    In other words
    I love you

            <pre>
    My mind's this cave
    So dark, no moon, no stars
    No sound, just hearts and walls of art
    
    Strange things happen
    For no reason
    That's all I know
    My mind's this cave
    So dark, no moon, no stars, no stars
    No sound, just hearts and walls of art
    
    These creatures I've seen
    Some of them edible, some of them mean
    That's all I know
    I'm not like you
    You fly
    You burn my eyes, my eyes
    You speak in my mind
    Your kind all died when you arrived
    
    I saw you making fire
    Strange things happen for no reason at all
    
    I can't help you
    You're not human
    You're not animal
    My mind's this cave
    So dark, no moon, no stars, no stars
    No sound, just hearts and walls of art
    And you, you fly
    You burn my eyes
    You speak in my mind
    You seem surprised that I don't hear you

    <p><em>
            <pre>
    I was running out in the cold light,
    Wondering where to go
    To run away, without you
    All my fear is coming home,
    And it's ripped out for the show
    You can't be me,
    I will become you, tonight
    I was wandering under black skies,
    Clutching at what is mine
    No control, left to lose
    When I felt that it wouldn't phase me,
    I ran and hid like a child
    I feel so guilty,
    I'll make it up to you, tonight

    They're changing my future
    Visions I had buried underground,
    Return us our futures
    
    I was breaking out of my own skin,
    Choking upon release
    I'm in no state, to judge you
    Scratching itches best left alone,
    Chasing memories I used to own
    I can't wait until this is over, tonight

    They're changing my future
    Visions I had buried underground,
    Return us our futures

    Well the nightmares I've been having have arrived,
    They're changing my future
    Signs of my creation at my door,
    How could you do this to her?
